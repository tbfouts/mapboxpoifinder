# mapboxpoifinder
A simple Android MapBox application for finding POI's using Kotlin

This application was created as a simple exploration of the MapBox Kotlin asynchronous search APIs.  A user can search around the center point of the map for POIs and find Mapbox metadata as listed results.  
Selecting the list button will show a list of the search results.  Selecting the "eye" button will fit all search results to view.

In order to build this application, you must procure a "secret key" or access token from Mapbox.  Define a gradle property MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN and set it to your personal token.
